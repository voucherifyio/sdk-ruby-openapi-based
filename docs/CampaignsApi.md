## add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign

> <CampaignsVouchersCreateResponseBody> add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign(campaign_id, code, opts)

Add Voucher with Specific Code to Campaign

This method gives a possibility to add a new voucher to an existing campaign. The voucher definition will be inherited from the definition kept in the campaign profile. However, you are able to overwrite a few properties inherited from the campaign.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Id
  config.api_key['X-App-Id'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Id'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Token
  config.api_key['X-App-Token'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Token'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = VoucherifySdk::CampaignsApi.new
campaign_id = 'ABC' # String | The campaign ID or name of the campaign to which voucher will be added. You can either pass the campaign ID, which was assigned by Voucherify, or the name of the campaign as the path parameter value.
code = 'code_example' # String | A custom **code** that identifies the voucher.
opts = {
  campaigns_vouchers_create_request_body: VoucherifySdk::CampaignsVouchersCreateRequestBody.new # CampaignsVouchersCreateRequestBody | Specify the voucher parameters that you would like to overwrite.
}

begin
  # Add Voucher with Specific Code to Campaign
  result = api_instance.add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign(campaign_id, code, opts)
  p result
rescue VoucherifySdk::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling CampaignsApi->add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign: #{e}"
end
```

#### Using the add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign_with_http_info variant

This returns an Array which contains the response data, status code and headers.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **campaign_id** | **String** | The campaign ID or name of the campaign to which voucher will be added. You can either pass the campaign ID, which was assigned by Voucherify, or the name of the campaign as the path parameter value. |  |

## add_vouchers_to_campaign

> <CampaignsVouchersCreateResponseBody> add_vouchers_to_campaign(campaign_id, opts)

Add Vouchers to Campaign

This method gives the possibility to push new vouchers to an existing campaign. New vouchers will inherit properties from the campaign profile. However, it is possible to overwrite some of them in the request body. If you provide an optional `code_config` parameter with a voucher code configuration, then it will be used to generate new voucher codes. Otherwise, the voucher code configuration from the campaign will be used.  This API request starts a process that affects Voucherify data in bulk.   In case of small jobs (like bulk update) the request is put into a queue and processed once every other bulk request placed in the queue prior to this request is finished. However, when the job takes a longer time (like vouchers generation) then it is processed in small portions in a round-robin fashion. When there is a list of vouchers generation scheduled, then they will all have the `IN_PROGRESS` status shortly. This way, small jobs added just after scheduling big jobs of the same type will be processed in a short time window.   The result will return the async ID. You can verify the status of your request via this [API request](ref:get-async-action).

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|

## import_vouchers_to_campaign

> <CampaignsImportCreateResponseBody> import_vouchers_to_campaign(campaign_id, opts)

Import Vouchers to Campaign

Imports vouchers to an **existing** campaign.  This API request starts a process that affects Voucherify data in bulk.   In case of small jobs (like bulk update) the request is put into a queue and processed once every other bulk request placed in the queue prior to this request is finished. However, when the job takes a longer time (like vouchers generation) then it is processed in small portions in a round-robin fashion. When there is a list of vouchers generation scheduled, then they will all have the `IN_PROGRESS` status shortly. This way, small jobs added just after scheduling big jobs of the same type will be processed in a short time window.   The result will return the async ID. You can verify the status of your request via this [API request](ref:get-async-action).

## import_vouchers_to_campaign_using_csv

> <CampaignsImportCsvCreateResponseBody> import_vouchers_to_campaign_using_csv(campaign_id, file)

Import Vouchers to Campaign by CSV

Imports vouchers to an **existing** campaign.     The CSV file has to include headers in the first line.   Curl Example <!-- title: \"Example Request\" lineNumbers: true --> ```cURL curl -X POST \\   https://api.voucherify.io/v1/campaigns/TEST-CAMPAIGN/importCSV \\   -F file=@/path/to/campaigns.csv \\   -H \"X-App-Id: c70a6f00-cf91-4756-9df5-47628850002b\" \\   -H \"X-App-Token: 3266b9f8-e246-4f79-bdf0-833929b1380c\" ```  You can import values for the following fields: `Code` (**required**), `Category`, `Active`. In a gift cards import, you can also include the current card balance using the `Gift Amount` header and the amount that was redeemed using the `Redeemed Amount` header. In a loyalty cards import, you can also include the current loyalty card score in points using the `Loyalty Points` header. Remaining CSV columns will be mapped to metadata properties.   Discount type, time limits, and validation rules will be taken from the <!-- [campaign object](OpenAPI.json/components/schemas/Campaign) -->[campaign object](ref:get-campaign) settings.    | **Active** | **Code** | **Loyalty Points** | **Gift Amount** | **Redeemed Amount** | **Redeemed Quantity** | **Category** | **Custom_metadata_property** | |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| | Use `true` or `false` to enable or disable the voucher; this flag can be used to turn off the ability to redeem a voucher even though it is within the campaign's start/end validity timeframe. | The unique voucher code. | The number of points to be added to the loyalty card. If you leave this undefined, then the initial number of points will be set according to the campaign settings.<br>Context: `LOYALTY_PROGRAM` | The initial gift card balance.<br>Context: `GIFT_VOUCHERS` | The amount that was redeemed from the available balance on a gift card. | The number of times the voucher has been redeemed. | A custom tag for the voucher to help you filter codes; you can either import the category name or a unique Voucherify-assigned category ID. | Any additional data that you would like to store for the given loyalty card as a Custom attribute. Remember to define the metadata schema in the Dashboard prior to importing codes. | |<!-- theme: info -->  > ðŸ“˜ Active > > The CSV file is allowed in two versions; either with or without a column titled `Active`. It indicates whether the voucher is enabled after the import event.    This API request starts a process that affects Voucherify data in bulk.   In case of small jobs (like bulk update) the request is put into a queue and processed once every other bulk request placed in the queue prior to this request is finished. However, when the job takes a longer time (like vouchers generation) then it is processed in small portions in a round-robin fashion. When there is a list of vouchers generation scheduled, then they will all have the `IN_PROGRESS` status shortly. This way, small jobs added just after scheduling big jobs of the same type will be processed in a short time window.   The result will return the async ID. You can verify the status of your request via this [API request](ref:get-async-action).

### Examples

## list_campaigns

> <CampaignsListResponseBody> list_campaigns(opts)

List Campaigns

Retrieve a list of campaigns in a project.   The campaigns are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recent campaigns appearing first.    When you get a list of campaigns, you can optionally specify query parameters to customize the amount of campaigns returned per call using `limit`, which page of campaigns to return using `page`, sort the campaigns using the `order` query parameter and filter the results by the `campaign_type`.  This method will return an error when trying to return a limit of more than 100 campaigns.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Id
